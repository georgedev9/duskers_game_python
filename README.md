This is the *Duskers* project I made myself.

Practice with Object-Oriented Programming and work with generators, file handling, and modules such as time, datetime, sys, and os. You will also get a chance to work with simple text-based GUIs.

Create a strategic game inspired by "Duskers" where a team of robots explores mysterious locations and looks for titanium. You will build it from scratch starting from the menu and adding the game hub, some animation, a few upgrade options, and some spooky enemies to spice things up.

This project does the following tasks:

* This is the very beginning. We will greet the player with a custom welcome message, and see if they're ready for an adventure! You must also come up with a name for your game, which will be displayed with glory in ASCII/Unicode word art on the title screen.
* Add simple "text-GUI" elements such as animations and a HUB for the main game.
* Make your own robots represented by up to 7 lines of ASCII/Unicode art. The robots will wait for your orders patiently in the Hub.
* This is the stage where the game truly starts. Places for exploration will be generated randomly as you go. You get to implement command-line arguments for quick testing.
* It is time to add a very important function that will allow a player to save and load their games!
* This is the final stage where we clear everything up and make our game fun to play by putting up occasional enemies during our missions. Upgrades are also added.
